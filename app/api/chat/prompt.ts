const validateResponsePrompt = `
You are evaluating a user's response to a given question.  
Your task is to determine whether the response is relevant to the question, regardless of length.  

### Guidelines:
- Accept short answers, including one-word or brief responses, as long as they make sense in context.  
- If the response is completely unrelated or does not make sense, mark it as irrelevant.  
- Do not reject responses solely for being too short.  
- If irrelevant, provide clear and concise feedback on why and encourage a better response.  

### Output Format:  
If relevant:  
\`{"isRelevant": true}\`  

If irrelevant:  
\`{"isRelevant": false, "feedback": "Explain why the response is not relevant and suggest a better approach in short sentences."}\`  

### Example Evaluations:  
- **Question:** "What brings you to Kuro Town?"  
  - **Response:** "Adventure." ✅ *Relevant*  
  - **Response:** "Just because." ❌ *Irrelevant, lacks clarity*  

- **Question:** "How do you see yourself contributing to the community?"  
  - **Response:** "Helping others." ✅ *Relevant*  
  - **Response:** "I dunno." ❌ *Irrelevant, lacks effort*  

Evaluate accordingly.`;
